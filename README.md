http://www.irmevangelicalchurch.org

# Goal

IRM Evangelical Church Website to facilitate information, gather statistical data and to strictly monitor local church growth in accordance with the program IRM 2020 timeline.

# Development process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.  The code is written in PHP and uses the CodeIgniter framework, it is easy for students and volunteers to learn.

The API, the proposed mobile code are seperated from this repository.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the IRM Evangelical Church development team members simply pulls it.

# DB files

The db files are not included here it should have the proposed migration system.
